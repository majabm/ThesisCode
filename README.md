# ThesisCode

This repository contains the code I wrote for my masters thesis. Beneath follows a short description of what the various files contain. These descriptions assume the reader is familiar with aforementioned thesis. 

various-functions: This file contains some necessary functions that does not belong in any other file.

Lie-groups: In this file various Lie groups and Lie algebras are defined using classes.

physics-problems: Here the two physical problems are defined using classes. They are Eulerâ€™s free rigid body (FRB) and the N-fold pendulum. The latter is divided into three, for N=1, for N=2, and for a general N.

RKMK-methods: This file contains the class RKMK, which can be used to apply the RKMK methods Lie Euler, Heun Euler, and RKMK4.

plot-solutions: functions that plot the numerical solutions of FRB and the 2-fold pendulum.

plot-convergence-rates: functions that plots the convergence rates of the numerical solutions.

plot-properties: functions that plot various properties of the numerical solutions, in order to check if they are preserved.
